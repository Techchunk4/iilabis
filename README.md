# Iilabis: A Django Web Application

**Iilabis** is a web application built using Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture pattern provided by Django, and integrates front-end technologies for a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Django Backend**: Handles server-side logic and database interactions using Django's robust framework.
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behaviors to the front-end.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapted for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you’ll need the following installed on your local development environment:

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- Node.js (for managing JavaScript packages, if necessary)
- Pip (Python package manager)
- A virtual environment tool (optional, but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iilabis.git
cd iilabis
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install the dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up Django environment
Before running the server, apply database migrations:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create a superuser (for admin access)
To access Django's admin panel, you need to create a superuser:
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Run the development server
Start the Django development server to launch the app:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Frontend

The application uses the following frontend technologies:

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure and content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Ensures a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic content and user interactions on the client side.

You can add your custom JavaScript files in the `static/js` directory, and your CSS stylesheets in the `static/css` directory. These will be automatically loaded by Django.

## Deployment

For production deployment, you will need to configure:

- **Allowed Hosts** in `settings.py`.
- **Static files** to serve them using a web server like Nginx.
- A database system like **PostgreSQL** (instead of SQLite, used in development).
- A **Wsgi/Asgi server** like **Gunicorn** or **Daphne** for serving the app.
